				<h3>Instruction to writing pieces</h3>

				<p><b>A Play</b> is a story that is acted out by real people. A play has the following parts:</p>

				<p><b>Characters.</b> These are the people or animals in the story. They have a problem or a goal.</p>

				<p><b>Setting.</b> This is the place where the story happens.</p>

				<p><b>Plot. </b>These are the important actions in the story.</p>

				<p><b>Outcome. </b>This is the way the story ends.</p>

				<p>In many stories the main characters solve a problem or reach a goal. The script names all characters and tells what they say to each other. The script also tells how the characters move around during the play. Some plays have a narrator. The narrator acts like a storyteller and tells about the other characters and events.</p>

				<p>A play looks different from a story. First, you write a character’s name, and then you write what the character says. Then you write the next character’s name and what that character says and so on. You write also words that tell how each character moves or behaves. These words may be typed in italics.</p>
