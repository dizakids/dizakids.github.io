				<h3>Instruction to build comics	"My virtual family"</h3>
				<p>This year we begin to work with a Project of Comics-making. We’ll work with this Project during the whole year and issue different kind of comics to different topics. </p>
				<p>Studying the topic “The Family Time” you are proposed to do the first step to it. The task of this step is to create the main characters of your future stories, to give them appearance, characteristic features and of cause families and friends. </p>
				<p>You can make your Comics either in pictures or in photos. Making photo-comics will be a great fun because it means to act all roles yourselves. I do believe you’ll enjoy this work very much. </p>
				<p>First of all imagine who will be the main characters of your comics. Give them names and surnames, age, nationality. Describe their appearance; write about their likes and dislikes. </p>
				<p>Then, think about their families, relatives, family relationship (what members of family they are good/ bad with and why). </p>
				<p>You can either draw the characters or take photos of actors. Remember: with the help of make-up, wigs and costumes you can change any appearance, age and nationality. </p>
