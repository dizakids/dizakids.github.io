				<h3>Interview</h3>
	
				<p>Some days ago I had an interview with the headmaster of school # 107. The topic of the interview was "Success and successful people". The choice of M.L. Mazin was not occasional. I think he is a good example of successful person. Last year our school was tested and got the best mark. Our teachers are very skillful. A lot of their pupils win first places in different contests on different subjects every year. And I wondered if it was difficult to be a headmaster of such school and to keep school in such high level.</p>
				<p>Mikhail Leonidovich considers that it is very hard and responsible to lead a good school. He must keep in touch all that happen at school. A good headmaster is the one who knows all about pupils and workers. He does his best to create comfortable surrounding for successful work.</p>
				<p>He underlines that success in life means different things to different people. Mikhail Leonidovich. is sure that success is not only money, popularity and career. In his opinion a successful person is a person who has good health. Another idea of success focuses on relationships being surrounded by people who love you and care about you, spending time with family and devoted friends. He thinks he is a successful person as he has all necessary things mentioned above.</p>
				<p>When I asked Mikhail Leonidovich. if he dreamed to be a headmaster, he gave me an excellent answer. He used a famous Russian proverb: a bad soldier never dreams to be a general. He thinks that every man makes a determined effort to reach the heights of his profession.</p>
				<p>At the end of the interview he gave some advices. If you want to be successful you should love, value and respect people around you. You should be intelligent and industrious, and have real goals and dreams.</p>
